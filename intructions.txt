Project Template
To get started with the project, go to the workspace on the next page, where you'll find the project template files. You can work on your project and submit your work through this workspace. Alternatively, you can download the project template files from the Resources folder if you'd like to develop your project locally.

In addition to the data files, the project workspace includes six files:

test.ipynb displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
create_tables.py drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
etl.ipynb reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
etl.py reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.
sql_queries.py contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
README.md provides discussion on your project.
Project Steps
Below are steps you can follow to complete the project:

Create Tables
Write CREATE statements in sql_queries.py to create each table.
Write DROP statements in sql_queries.py to drop each table if it exists.
Run create_tables.py to create your database and tables.
Run test.ipynb to confirm the creation of your tables with the correct columns. Make sure to click "Restart kernel" to close the connection to the database after running this notebook.
Build ETL Processes
Follow instructions in the etl.ipynb notebook to develop ETL processes for each table. At the end of each table section, or at the end of the notebook, run test.ipynb to confirm that records were successfully inserted into each table. Remember to rerun create_tables.py to reset your tables before each time you run this notebook.

Build ETL Pipeline
Use what you've completed in etl.ipynb to complete etl.py, where you'll process the entire datasets. Remember to run create_tables.py before running etl.py to reset your tables. Run test.ipynb to confirm your records were successfully inserted into each table.

Document Process
Do the following steps in your README.md file.

Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
[Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.
Here's a guide on Markdown Syntax.

NOTE: You will not be able to run test.ipynb, etl.ipynb, or etl.py until you have run create_tables.py at least once to create the sparkifydb database, which these other files connect to.
Project Rubric
Read the project rubric before and during development of your project to ensure you meet all specifications.


num_songs:1
artist_id:"ARMJAGH1187FB546F3"
artist_latitude:35.14968
artist_longitude:-90.04892
artist_location:"Memphis, TN"
artist_name:"The Box Tops"
song_id:"SOCIWDW12A8C13D406"
title:"Soul Deep"
duration:148.03546
year:1969

This one is a little more complicated since information from the songs table, artists table, and original log file are all needed for the `songplays` table. Since the log file does not specify an ID for either the song or the artist, you'll need to get the song ID and artist ID by querying the songs and artists tables to find matches based on song title, artist name, and song duration time.
- Implement the `song_select` query in `sql_queries.py` to find the song ID and artist ID based on the title, artist name, and duration of a song.
- Select the timestamp, user ID, level, song ID, artist ID, session ID, location, and user agent and set to `songplay_data`

#### Insert Records into Songplays Table
- Implement the `songplay_table_insert` query and run the cell below to insert records for the songplay actions in this log file into the `songplays` table. Remember to run `create_tables.py` before running the cell below to ensure you've created/resetted the `songplays` table in the sparkify database.



The README file includes a summary of the project, how to run the Python scripts, and an explanation of the files in the repository. Comments are used effectively and each function has a docstring.

Scripts have an intuitive, easy-to-follow structure with code separated into logical functions. Naming for variables and functions follows the PEP8 style guidelines.
